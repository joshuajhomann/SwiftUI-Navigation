# TVMaze-SwiftUI-Navigation

Sample Swift UI project for exploring Navigation.  Flock of Swifts Meetup Jan 11, 2020.

The starter folder contains a demo swiftUI app using view based navigation.  The challenge is to refactor this logic to either use a Router/Coordinator, Shared AppState or some other logic to hoist the navigation out of the view layer.
